# pymd

## About

pymd is a Markdown viewer for Linux ( or any compatible OS ) written in Python. This program adheres to the *numero uno* rule of unix software development:

> Make each program do one thing well

Therefore, this program **only** renders Markdown files. You can not edit them, that is something you need another program for. I personally like `atom` or ElementaryOS' `Code` a lot.

## Interface

I have built this program to fit in the look and feel of ElementaryOS, but any tester on different systems like Fedora or Suse is wellcome to contribute to make it integrate well in other distros as well.

## Install

On any Ubuntu-ish Linux distro you will need the packet `gir1.2-webkit-3.0` to be installed.
Furthermore, the packet *mistune*, by Hsiaoming Yang, needs to be installed (see references below).

## Usage
